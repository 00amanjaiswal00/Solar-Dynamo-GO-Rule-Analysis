# Solar-Dynamo-GO-Rule-Analysis

This repository contains my Jupyter Notebook **GO_Rule_Analysis_Final.ipynb**, which presents a data-driven investigation of the Gnevyshev–Ohl (GO) rule and its connection to solar dynamo behavior.

## Overview
The analysis involves studying sunspot latitude, area, and number to explore:
- GO rule compliance and violations  
- Hemispheric asymmetry index  
- Polarity reversals post-1976  
- Wavelet and STFT analyses of solar activity cycles  

## Tools and Methods
Developed entirely in **Python** using:
`NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Pandas`, `SciPy`, `PyWavelets`, and other scientific libraries for data visualization and computational analysis.

## About
This work reflects my ability to perform **data-driven physics research**, handle **real-world observational data**, and derive **quantitative insights** through computational modeling.
